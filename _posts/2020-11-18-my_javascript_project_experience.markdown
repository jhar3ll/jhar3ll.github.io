Long days and long nights. Frustration, happyness, eagerness, determination, fatigue. This is a small list of the emotions I experienced while working on this project and I imagine that I'm still not done yet (haha). 

This project is probably the first of the three so far that I'm most confident in explaing execution-point to execution-point. I wouldn't dare say that Javascript is easier than any other language; I just feel like I understand it better than I did when learning languages prior to this one. Maybe that's because I've learned the other languages already; who knows.

Sometimes I couldn't sleep because I would hit a bump in my project trying to implement certain functionality. I would lay in bed and wonder, "would it work if I did this? this? that? ohhhh! maybe this!" ... and eventually I would fall asleep only to wake up in the morning so eager to try a different *method* (or function). Sometimes I would be at work thinking of ways to solve a problem in my project and it would bum me out sooooo much that I couldn't just pull out my laptop and code. 

I will have to say that I enjoyed working on it and it has given me a little boost in confidence as far as being a developer. I am eager to see where it goes from here.
