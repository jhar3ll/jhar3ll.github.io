Before getting to this mod, I thought that the Ruby Project was tough. Ruby, alone, is and was challenging, but this was an entire different animal. 

Of course everything in this project came from what I learned in this mod along with the previous mod, but that didn't keep me from being intimidated by the complexity my program would. On the surface of my program, it seems really simple. Sign up or sign in. Add some games to a collection. Edit or remove games in your collection. Done. But behind the scenes, it took hours and hours of hard work to get there. 

I always do enjoy learning something new and especially when working on a project like this, it's fun to fix bugs or add some functionality that you didn't have before. I'm looking forward to the next mod and the next big project.
