During my time in college, I switched majors twice. I went from Music Education, to Computer Science, and finally finished my degree in Accounting. I enjoyed the material during my time in Computer Science but it was a rough time for me personally so I ended up taking some time off before coming back to switch to Accounting. 

I enjoyed Accounting and learned some valuable material; both textbook and real-world. After graduation, I never took any jobs in Accounting simply because I enjoy working as an Automotive Technician. One day, I came across The Flatiron School and thought I'd take a shot at the prework. 

I really enjoyed the material and how much I was learning in short periods of time. I enjoyed the challenge of learning material, and subsequently using what I learned to **create** something. That's the biggest reason I'm doing this. I do enjoy working on vehicles; taking something that is broken and bringing it back to life. However, I enjoy creating things more than fixing.

That's why I decided to learn software development: to create.
