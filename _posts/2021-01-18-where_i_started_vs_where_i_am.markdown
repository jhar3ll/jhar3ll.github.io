I think it goes without saying that I, along with all of the other Flatiron students, have come a **long** way from learning basic coding fundamentals many, many months ago. I never thought that this would be as challenging as it was/is, and that I would have the knowledge and abilities that I've obtained from this Cohort.

Learning to be a developer is a very intimidating task. Looking at people who have been in the industry for years and have gained so much knowledge makes you wonder if you'll ever be as good as they are. I know that even once I'm done with the cohort, I still have a lot to learn. I know that every day is a learning experience and an opportunity to become that much of a better developer. I know I won't have "homework" when I get home (maybe I will haha), but I'll still need to be learning to the be the best that I can be.

Reflecting on when I started with Flatiron and where I am today is a really crazy thought. I went from learning what a variable is, how to declare a variable, what's a string, integer, and all of these simple, yet, crucial concepts, to writing entire applications that do whatever I want them to. I'm proud of the work I've done in this cohort. I'm not sure if this is one of those things people say that they would do all over again if they could, but this experience has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life; hands down.
