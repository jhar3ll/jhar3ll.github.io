I'm not sure if I've ever been so overwhelmed in my life. React didn't make sense. Then it clicked. Redux *really* didn't make sense. After multiple labs, it clicked; kind of. I didn't grasp Redux until I was full swing into my project and that's crazy to me.

Trying to juggle working full-time along with Flatiron is one the most difficult things I've ever attempted to do in my life. It was especially difficult trying to learn a new language/framework while working full-time that even after weeks of material I **still didn't get it! Ugh!**

I will say, though, that after all the material throughout this cohort, not just React/Redux, it was nice to put all of the pieces together. Projects are always difficult, stressful, and challenging, but the challenge and the subsequent success makes it all worth it.
