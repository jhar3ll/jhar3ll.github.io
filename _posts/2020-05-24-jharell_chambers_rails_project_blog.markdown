Like all projects, the Rails project intimidated me way before I even thought about starting. I knew there were going to hundreds of files, thousands of lines of code, problems I would face that would drive me crazy and take HOURS to figure out. The one thing I didn't expect was how much I would learn after having a working application. Even after all of the lessons, the project REALLY helps to bring it all together. It makes me excited for the future and the future projects even though I'll be pulling my hair out during the next one. 

I learned so much from putting this together and I'm starting to feel like I could actually be a developer one day. The idea of being an actual developer is still very farfetched to me. Whenever I look up how to do somethings in Rails, I come across these answers and think to myself, "how does this guy/girl know so much?". It blows my mind and also kind of discourages me. But I try to tell myself I'll be there one day. 

I'm excited to start Javascript.
